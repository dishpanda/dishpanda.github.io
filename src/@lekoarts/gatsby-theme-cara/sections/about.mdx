# About
## Currently, I'm a senior at California High School, San Ramon.
I'm fascinated by mathematics, computer science, robotics and the connections between the three. Yet to receive a high school diploma, I turn to the community college to take mathematics courses to quench my thirst for knowledge.

I fell in love with programming way back in 3rd grade, when I checked out a book on Python programming for game building. I've spent the last 9-10 years honing my skills in programming and computer science.

Now, I find that most of my programming happens either for web development or in C++ for my team's robot.

When Iâ€™m not at a computer, I enjoy writing poetry, learning foreign languages, shooting on film, or playing *bansuri*. At a party, you'll be able to find me talking to anyone who'll listen.
