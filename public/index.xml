      <description>Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m Rahul. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m a senior at California High School, San Ramon. I&amp;rsquo;ll be a freshman at Cal Poly SLO this fall.
I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by mathematics, computer science, robotics, and the connections between the three.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not using a computer, I like to write poetry, learn foreign languages, shoot photos on film, and play the Indian classical flute––the bansuri. At a party, you&amp;rsquo;ll find me talking to anyone who&amp;rsquo;ll lend an ear.</description>

      <description>A pleasure to teach
reads my report card every year
a smiley face, as if this is favorable
A pleasure to teach
means validation from mama and baba
A pleasure to teach
means my anxiety is invalid
because “you did so well in school!”
A pleasure to teach
tells me i’m not fun
A pleasure to teach
means i shouldn’t try
A pleasure to teach
tells me i’m not smart</description>
