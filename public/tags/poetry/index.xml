      <description>A pleasure to teach
reads my report card every year
a smiley face, as if this is favorable
A pleasure to teach
means validation from mama and baba
A pleasure to teach
means my anxiety is invalid
because “you did so well in school!”
A pleasure to teach
tells me i’m not fun
A pleasure to teach
means i shouldn’t try
A pleasure to teach
tells me i’m not smart</description>
