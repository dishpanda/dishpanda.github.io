        <p>These past few days have been a roller coaster.</p>    
        <p>I turned seventeen on the fourth of January. I went out to lunch with Alyanna in the morning and then had a robotics meeting, after which I went out to dinner with my family. On our way back, though, we got into a car accident. My dad’s car was totaled. Certainly, this was a birthday to remember.        </p>
        <p>On the fifth of January, I ended up sad-texting a bunch of my friends apologizing in my first panic attack of the year. Later though, I was reminded of what it means to have good friends who are always there for you.</p>
        <p>The sixth of January reminded me what it’s like to have a good relationship with your family. My mom and dad were having ice cream in the living room as I walked out into the room, and looked at me with the guiltiest look on their faces. I thought it was the funniest thing, and they scooped me some ice cream and we just had a good time. I really liked that.</p>
        <p>I’m hoping to spend some more time with family tomorrow— I know my mom wants to go to Daiso with me. </p>
        <p>I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m really looking forward to school starting again on Tuesday. It’s going to be a blast meeting up with everyone. I just hope I get to hang out with friends outside of school. However, I don’t know how well I’ll be able to keep these up, but I guess I’ll try my best. Maybe my friend Google will help me remember.
        </p>
        <p>I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed when I think of the ACT again. It’s only  5 weeks until I take it again, and I don’t even have a plan. Not only that, I still have to take my SAT Subject Tests in math and physics— neither of which I’ve even begun to prepare for. Piling on to this, a friendly email from Fiveable cheerfully let me know that I have only 17 weeks until AP testing! Which means I need to up my game in APUSH, Comp Sci, and Calc if I want to remain competent. Funnily enough, I’m not stressed about Biology (which, when selecting courses last year I had thought would be my toughest class).
        </p>
        <p>I need to try harder at everything I do this semester, because this is where it matters. This is what will decide my colleges. I need to keep my mental health at its peak for most nights otherwise I won’t make it… I suppose in this domesticated world it’s a substitute for natural selection.
