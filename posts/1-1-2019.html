        <p>Hello 2019. This is the first of January and I’m 3 days away from my 17th birthday and I’m honestly quite excited. This year seems like it’s going to be better. It feels as if a veil has been lifted off of my head, a wall lifted. Humanity may have been cursed (or maybe it was just me) for 2016-2018 but I really feel like it’s going to be better in 2019. This year is my year. I’ve already come out to more people than I’ve ever before, and I look forward to finding the courage to just do it.</p>
        <p>These past few months I was lost, in a void that I thought I would never escape. I wanted to kill myself most nights, and cried more than ever. I cried myself to sleep every night. I attempted to run away from home and got caught leaving. But, these past few weeks were so good to me— I spent time with Shea and Shaun, I reconnected with people from Sunnyvale and had a good time there. I suppose the saying is true: it’s always darkest before the dawn.</p>
        <p>I didn’t plan on making a New Year’s Resolution for this year, thinking, “What’s the point? I’m never going to fulfill them since I’ll be dead before July.” But December has changed me. My whole outlook on life has changed in a matter of hours and I’m here for it. This year, I really want to spend more time with the people I care about. This means spending more time at Shaun’s house, more days with Alyanna, more with Jewel and Shea and everyone else. It also means I head out to Sunnyvale more because I care about all of the people there.</p>
        <p>Another thing I’ve been thinking about doing this year is seriously filming a recap video for the year. It’s going to be a blast and I hope my friends will be as into it as I will be. </p>
        <p>Lastly, I want to keep writing like this. This is the first in a series of essays I want to do this year; I’m hoping that it’ll make me a better writer and a more positive person. 2019 is my year. It’s a year of change. And I sincerely hope that it’ll be for the better.</p>
