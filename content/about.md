# **Hey! I'm Rahul.**

Currently, I'm a senior at California High School, San Ramon. I'll be a freshman
at Cal Poly SLO this fall.

I'm fascinated by mathematics, computer science, robotics, and the connections between the three.

When I'm not using a computer, I like to write poetry, learn foreign languages,
shoot photos on film, and play the Indian classical flute––the bansuri. At a party, you'll find me
talking to anyone who'll lend an ear. You can find more of my work on this
website, and don't hesitate to get in touch :)
